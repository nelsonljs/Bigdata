The codes are presented in Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb) so that the output can be visualized.
To generate Python scripts, save the .ipynb files as .py file format from File > Download as > .py

The main scripts are:
01_source.ipynb
02_cleaning_allrecipes.ipynb
03_drill.ipynb
UI.R
server.R


Alternative scripts for different recipe databases:
01_source.ipynb retrieves recipes from All Recipes database. For BBC recipe or other recipe database, change the URL accordingly and file path for saving.

02_cleaning_allrecipes.ipynb cleans recipes from All Recipes database. For BBC recipe or other recipe database, the same script can be used (e.g. 02_cleaning_bbc.ipynb), but need to just change the file path for saving.
